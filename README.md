# budget

This is a web application for personal budgeting, built with Angular and TaigaUI. You can use it, though I primarily developed it as a demonstration of my skills.

Version 1.0.0 stores your financial data in your browser's local storage. Thereâ€™s no need to log in. However, if you clear your local storage, all your data will be lost.

You can add expenses and incomes, view analytics, and track transactions by date and category. The most important and impressive feature is that you can add an expense with just two taps.
